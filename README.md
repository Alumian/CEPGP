# Classic-EPGP
**Do not redistribute this addon. Post a link to this github page instead**


An addon designed to handle your guild's EPGP standings by storing the respective values in your Officer Notes. Another primary function of the addon is to handle loot moderation which you must be the master looter to utilise.

For this addon to work, anyone using the addon must be able to at the very least view Officer Notes. To adjust EP and GP values you must be able to edit Officer Notes.

The addon is entirely GUI based and the frame is designed to only appear automatically on raid bosses from Molten Core, Onyxia's Lair and World Bosses all the way up to Naxxramas.

Functionality:
* /cepgp show - Shows the CEPGP window
* /cepgp debug - Enables debug mode
* /cepgp setdefaultchannel - Changes the default reporting channel. This is set to Guild by default
* /cepgp check - Allows you to check if each raid member is running the addon - and if so, what version of the addon they are using

To install:
  1. Download this addon 
  2. Extract it to ../Interface/AddOns/ 
  3. Rename the extracted folder from CEPGP-master to CEPGP

**Note:**
Automatic retrieval of a recipient's item they currently have in slot when they whisper you !need has been added. This is only possible **if the loot master has the item that the recipient is wearing, in their game cache**. This is a restriction enforced by the 1.12.1 API.

Patch Version: 1.12.1
